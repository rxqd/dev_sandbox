# Sandbox for learning and practice 

> The idea is to check how the same thing can be implemented with different languages

## Version meaning

### 1.2.3 means:

- 1 module
- 2 concepts (in the modules)
- 3 minor changes

## Available languages

- [Javascript](javascript/)
- [Python](python/)
- [Rust](rust/)

## TODO

- [ ] Prevent push if CHANGELOG and version are not modified but other files are
- [ ] Add unit testing
- [ ] Add github actions
- [ ] Copy all difs in one sandbox to other sandboxes with comments (create a file with name ":lang-version-date.")
- [ ] Check which sandboxes are not sync
- [ ] Add Makefile to do action
- [ ] Decide what language to use for the main sandbox. No, bash, no, not today :see_no_evil: Python? Rust? Go? :monocle_face:
- [ ] Script to create a new sandbox with required files
